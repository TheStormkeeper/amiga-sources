HuffPacker is a file packer which uses the Huffman algorithm. It's the
WORST packer I've ever seen so...

HuffPacker can only be run from the CLI. It's CLI line syntax is :

	HuffPacker [-R] <InFile> <OutFile>

+ <InFile> is the name of the file to be packed
+ <OutFile> is the name of the packed file
+ -R is an option that allow you to remove or not the Hunk_Code of a program.
  It's useful when you work in absolute with an assembler that can't generate
  Image code like seka does ( for example devpac ). The hunk will be removed
  and you will only get the code of your program. In this case, <Infile> MUST
  be an executable file ( if there is more than one hunk in the program, only
  the first Hunk_Code will be used ). This option is by default OFF ( no -R )

When a file has been packed you see the following display
		Unpacked Size..........xxxxxx
		Packed Size............xxxxxx
		Gain...................xxxxxx
		Huffman Buffer Size....xxxxxx

When you have packed a file, you will surely like to depack it so there is a
source code called HuffDepacker.s that allow you to do it
you have to include it into your source to do that.
when you want to decrunch something, put in a0 the address of the packed file,
in a1 the address where you want to decrunch and in a1 the address of a
memory space where the Huffman Tree can be rebuild. The size of this space is
given when a file has been successfully crunched or is given by the following
formula :  (First Word of the Packed File)*16+8
