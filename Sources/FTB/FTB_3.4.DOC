				By Sync of DreamDealers

	FTB is a small proggy that help you to play with the disk blocks
	of a disk. FTB has a format option, a disk bitmap editor and a
	file installer on disk blocks with the option to extract the first
	hunk of executable or to write the whole file ( ??!! ).

	You can run FTB from CLI or WB. You MUST have the req.library in your
	LIBS: otherwise FTB will simply exit...	If FTB is already running, you
	can't run it another time. First of all, you can see that some letters
	are underlined : it's the keyboard short-cut.

	The gadgets on the FTB window are the following ones :

	- SELECT FILE
		This gadget allow you to select a file to install on disk.
		The FileRequester used is the one of the req.library v2.5.
		SHORTCUT : press "F"

	- START BLOCK
		This gadget allow you to choose the block ( INCLUSIVE ) 
		where the installation must start.
		The Start Block is in decimal.
		SHORTCUT : press "S"

	- END BLOCK
		This gadget allow you to choose the block ( INCLUSIVE )
		where the installation must stop.
		The End Block is in decimal.
		This option is deactivated when End Block equ 1759 ( in fact,
		the installation stops when the last block of a disk is
		reached ).
		SHORTCUT : press "E"

	- NEXT OPTION
		This gadget display the next installation mode of FTB.
		The current installation mode is displayed at the right of
		the gadget.
		There are 4 modes :
			* Install Full File :
				All file will be written to disk.

			* Install Only Hunk_Code :
				FTB will install only the hunk code of
				the selected file ( which must be executable )
				See below for more information on Hunk_Code.

			* Install Full File + CheckSum :
				All file will be written to disk and THEN a
				CheckSum of the bootblock disk will be done.

			* Install Hunk_Code + CheckSum :
				FTB will install only the hunk code of
				the selected file ( which must be executable )
				and THEN do the CheckSum of the disk bootblock.
				See below for more information on Hunk_Code.
		SHORTCUT : press "N"

	- START
		This gadget start the installation.
		BE CAREFUL THAT THE DISK IN DF0: IS THE DISK YOU WANT TO
		WRITE TO !!!!
		If an error occure during the installation, a requester will
		tell it to you.
		SHORTCUT : press "T"
	
	- STOP
		This gadget abort the installation.
		SHORTCUT : press "O"
	
	- BITMAP
		When you select it, a new window appears : it's a disk bitmap
		editor !! Yeah dudes, you can now edit the bitmap of your
		disk and even the EMFLAG for its validation. Great no ?
		When the mouse is on the Bitmap field you've got some info
		on the top of this window ( TRACK, SECTOR, BLOCK etc.. ).
		You can READ the bitmap of a disk in DF0: and also write it
		on the disk in DF0: ( when you want to edit the bitmap of a
		disk, click the READ gadget because FTB display an empty
		bitmap by default when entering in this section..)
		The EDIT MODE determines what action it does when you click
		the mousebuttons on the bitmap field ( Allocate Blocks
		and Free Blocks ). Note that blocks 0 & 1 or ALWAYS allocated
		on a standard disk. The left mousebutton do what the EDIT mode
		say and the right mousebutton do the opposite action ( yeahh,
		it's a bit like in Dpaint !! )
		the VALID gadget let you select if the bitmap is valid or not.
		Yeah, that's all for this Bitmap Editor, except that you exit
		when you click the CLOSEWINDOW gadget.
		SHORTCUTS : press "B" for the Bitmap Editor
			    press "R" for READ
			    press "W" for WRITE
			    press "E" for EDIT MODE
			    press "V" for VALID

	- FORMAT
		Yes, now you can format your disk ! When you select this gadget,
		a string gadget appears and ask you the name of the disk.
		If you want to abort, then click the CANCEL gadget otherwise
		enter its name. Then a window appears with a progress bar.
		Simply wait until the end of the format and you should have
		a formated disk if no error occured.
		If ya want to stop while formating, simply remove the disk
		from DF0: ( Hummmm !!...)
		SHORTCUT : press "M"

	- ICONIZE
		This gadget will iconize the FTB window to a small one.
		When the window is iconized, activate the window and click the
		right mouse button to make the FTB window to reapear.
		NOTE: If there is not enough memory to reopen the window,
		FTB will simply exit without any warning !
		SHORTCUT : press "I"

	- ABOUT
		Guess what it is ?!  Yeahh , it's the credits with my addy !!
		SHORTCUT : press "A"

	- LOCK DF0 ( the bit gadget with a disk drawn in it...)
		Another great option !! It's let you select if the DF0
		can validate disk when they are inserted in DF0.
		It's really great if you write on a disk and you don't want
		another task to access the DF0 and it's also very great
		if you want to edit some disk with the EMFLAG cleared ( like
		with the 1st disk of Spring Melodies/Anarchy !! You can now hack
		it if you don't have the KickStart 2.04 + !! Just modify the
		validity of the bitmap !!!! )
		SHORTCUT : press "L"

	- The information area:
		When FTB is installing a file to a disk, you can see there
		on which block FTB writes.
		If the installation is successful (meaning no error request),
		you can see on which blocks your file has been installed
		(INCLUSIVE).
		Each information is displayed in decimal.


	About Hunk_Code :
		As you perhaps know, executables are not written to disk
		as they are in memory.
		In an executable file, there is at least a hunk called
		Hunk_Code : it's the code of the program.
		There are usually others hunks called Hunk_Reloc : these
		hunks are used by the Amiga to relocate the Hunk_Code at any
		place in memory.
		If there is no Hunk_Reloc that's because the program was
		written in relative-PC or in ORG.
		So if you wanna install only the Hunk_Code of a program,
		it should not have a Hunk_Reloc otherwise the program
		won't work when on disk blocks ( like for a demo for
		example ).
		By the way , FTB will ONLY INSTALL THE FIRST HUNK_CODE
		found since there could have MORE than one Hunk_Code in an
		executable.

	
	Bugs of FTB v3.4:
		Yes, I've seen only a single "bug" ( if we can call thiz a
		bug..) : Well, when you enter in the bitmap editor for
		example, you can still click on the FTB window's gadgets...
		The effect is not immediate as Intuition buffered all
		IntuiMsg so when you exit the bitmap editor all the action
		are THEN done (??! try it..) . SO PLEASE  don't do that
		coz' you could have some problems ( don't be affraid,
		no GURU at all !!)
